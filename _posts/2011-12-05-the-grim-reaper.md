This makes pretty grim reading - Every death on every road in Great Britain 1999-2010.

It would seem if you're a cyclist and you want to stay alive then you should avoid riding during the Monday to Friday rush hours and not bother heading out on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon.

Strangely, looking at the map of bike casualties in the Glasgow area, most of them seem to occur in fine weather during daylight. There also seems to be a disproportionate number of old men (60+)  involved.

If the map is accurate and to be believed it looks like one guy died while cycling along the M74.

Thankfully though, the general trend for the number of cyclists being killed on the roads between 1999 - 2010 seems to heading downwards. This has got to be a good thing considering the number of cyclists on the road during that time has most definitely been on the rise.

Don't let the doom mongers put you off and get out and ride!
