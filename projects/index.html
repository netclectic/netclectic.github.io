<p>My cycling / photography site – <a title="Cycleography.com" href="http://www.cycleography.com" target="_blank">cycleography.com</a></p>

<h1>phpBB</h1>
<p>One of these days I might get round to uploading the various phpBB mods that used to reside here in a previous life. In the mean time here’s some links to some phpbb mods I made:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Insert Post" href="http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?t=45535" target="_blank">Insert Post</a> – This functions is used to insert a post into your phpbb forums. It handles all the related bits like updating post counts, indexing search words, etc. The post is inserted for a specific user, so you will have to already have a user setup which you want to use with it.</li>
<li><a title="FIND - Forum Integrated News Delivery" href="http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?t=42364" target="_blank">FIND – Forum Integrated News Delivery</a> – Delivers rss / xml newsfeeds direct to your forums.</li>
<li><a title="View Profile Sig" href="http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?t=149836" target="_blank">View Profile Sig</a> – Adds the user’s signature to their view profile page.</li>
<li><a title="Watched Topics List" href="http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?t=100096" target="_blank">Watched Topics List</a> – Adds a watched topics list so users can easily manage the topics they are watching.</li>
</ul>
<p>And lots more… which I can’t be bothered tracking down. The phpBB site (and software) has changed a lot since I last looked at it, and not all for the better!</p>
<p>N.B. These were all developed for phpBB v2 and will most likely not work with the latest version of phpBB.</p>
